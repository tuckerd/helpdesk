### Installation
This app requires that you have postgres installed on your local system with a
database called helpdesk_development and helpdesk_test along with an appropiate user.
Make sure you update your database.yml file to reflect this or use foremen and a .env file
with the appropiate ENV variables.

App Secret Key:  Your own secret key must be included in the .env file which can be 
generated by running `rake secret`. See .env_example for an example of what the file
should look like.
